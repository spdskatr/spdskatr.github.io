# Property-based testing resources

Hi! You're probably here because of some talk or lecture I did on property-based testing. A download link to the slides will also appear here after the talk

Slides: [Handout](https://spdskatr.github.io/misc/pbt_presentation_short.pdf)

Here are some resources I found quite useful when researching this topic.

Special thanks to the University of New South Wales course COMP3141 "[Software System Design and Implementation](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs3141/)" for initially introducing me to property-based testing.

Thanks for listening! ~ðŸ’œ
