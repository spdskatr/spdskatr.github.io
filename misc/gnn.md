# Intro to Graph Representation Learning

Hi! Youâ€™re probably here because of some talk or lecture I did on graph representation learning. A download link to the slides will also appear here after the talk.

- Are GNNs universal? Can GNNs express any function on graphs?
	- Short answer: It depends
	- Essentially, since graph isomorphism is in NP, determining graph structure up to isomorphism is already very hard.
	- There's a very good approximate algorithm to solve the graph isomorphism problem called the "Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test"
	- We can compare our existing architectures to see whether they can simulate this test
